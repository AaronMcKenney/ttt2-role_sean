The Seance is an Innocent role who can see spectators (sort of). There is a 30 second delay between the player's death and when their "ghost" becomes visible by default. These "ghosts" look like semi-transparent yellow orbs which follow the spectator. They only update their positions every 10 seconds or so, and are offset from the spectator's actual position (so if 6 dead players are spectating the same player, the Seance will see 6 yellow orbs near the player in question, despite all 6 spectators occupying the same position).
 
In addition, when one of these orbs appears, the Seance is informed about the recently deceased player's death as well as the number of dead players. Both of these tidbits of information will be 30 seconds old, with their appearance corresponding with the appearance of the "ghosts".
 
If a Spectator is possessing a prop, the Seance will perceive a yellow glow about the prop, similar to how spectators see possessed props.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
